- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Maximus Burwood.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in computational biology, simulation-based studies, and the interplay of algorithms with natural systems. I have a passion for evolutionary simulations, genomics, and deep learning techniques for biological data analysis. Beyond that, Iâ€™m keen on exploring high-performance computing and assembly-level optimization.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning genomic data structures, vectorised computing techniques, and GPU acceleration for scientific computation. I'm also delving deeper into evolutionary algorithms and their real-world applications.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: drop me an email at maximus.burwood@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximus-burwood/.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I got fed up with the glacial pace of C++ (you know, that high-level, super-inefficient language), so I decided to learn x86 assembly. Because why not trade readability and sanity for a 45% increase in speed? Totally worth it!
